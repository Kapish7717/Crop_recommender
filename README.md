This project is an intelligent Crop Recommendation System that helps farmers and agricultural enthusiasts choose the most suitable crop based on environmental and soil parameters. The system combines unsupervised learning (KMeans clustering) for exploratory data analysis and supervised learning (Random Forest classifier) for accurate crop prediction.

Key Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with KMeans: Groups similar soil and environmental conditions to identify patterns and insights.

Random Forest Classifier: Predicts the optimal crop for cultivation using the input features.

Data-Driven Recommendations: Helps maximize yield and optimize farming decisions.

User-Friendly Structure: Easy to understand and extend for future improvements.

Input Parameters (examples):

Soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium)

Soil pH level

Rainfall

Temperature

Humidity

Output:

Recommended crop(s) suitable for cultivation based on the provided conditions.

Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA)

Scikit-learn (KMeans clustering, Random Forest classifier)

Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and model training

Use Cases:

Crop planning for farmers

Agricultural decision support

Maximizing crop yield and sustainability
